<LI>I'm not sure I've got attack & decay the right way around in the
expander plugins.</LI>

<LI>Need to have a look at dynamic.cpp for handling of unusual
arithmetic situation such as <CODE>isnan()</CODE>,
<CODE>isinf()</CODE> etc.</LI>

<LI>Memory management is a little haphazard at present. What happens
when <CODE>new()</CODE> fails? The host can use
<CODE>set_new_handler()</CODE>, but I suspect this needs further
thought anyway.</LI>
