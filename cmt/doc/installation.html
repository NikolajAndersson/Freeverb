<H1>CMT Installation</H1>

<P>To build the plugin library, enter the <CODE>src/</CODE> directory
and run <CODE>make</CODE>. The makefile expects to find the
<CODE>ladspa.h</CODE> header file in your include path or
<CODE>/usr/local/include/</CODE>. If you do not have this file it can
be downloaded as part of the LADSPA SDK from <A
HREF="http://www.ladspa.org/download/">
http://www.ladspa.org/download/</A>.</P>

<P>Running <CODE>make</CODE> will generate the CMT LADSPA plugin
library (<CODE>cmt.so</CODE>) in the <CODE>plugins/</CODE>
directory. This can be moved to an appropriate location depending on
the application you are using. Running <CODE>make install</CODE> from
the <CODE>src/</CODE> directory as root will install to
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/ladspa/</CODE> which is on the search path
recommended for hosts looking for plugin libraries. Some applications
may not search this directory automatically.</P>
